AWS Bedrock GenAI Workshop – Hands-on Guide

This repository documents my learning journey from the AWS Data-Driven Everything workshop on Mastering Enterprise Gen AI: Building production applications with Amazon Bedrock.

It includes step-by-step lab notes, architecture diagrams, and screenshots on how to:

🚀 Core Topics

Amazon Nova Models – Real-time speech (Nova Sonic) & agentic actions (Nova Act).

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases – Combining structured (Redshift) and unstructured (S3 + Titan embeddings + OpenSearch) data with RAG.

Amazon Q – Generative AI assistant for Business, Developers, Redshift, Connect, and QuickSight.

Generative SQL in Redshift – Turn plain English queries into optimized SQL.

Guardrails – Building safe, responsible, enterprise-grade AI apps.

Bedrock Flows – Drag-and-drop orchestration of multi-step workflows.

🧪 Labs
1. Knowledge Base with Business Data

Enabled Titan embeddings & Nova models.

Connected Redshift Serverless for structured data.

Indexed S3 + OpenSearch for unstructured data.

Built hybrid knowledge bases for RAG queries.

➡️ Step-by-step guide

2. Prompt Management, Agents, Guardrails

Created managed prompts.

Implemented Guardrails for privacy & hallucination control.

Configured Bedrock Agents to interact with knowledge bases.

➡️ Step-by-step guide

3. Bedrock Flows – Visual AI Pipelines

Designed a flow that classifies & routes support tickets.

Integrated Redshift + Vector KBs.

Applied conditional routing for different inquiry types.

➡️ Step-by-step guide

4. Generative SQL in Redshift

Used Amazon Q for plain English to SQL.

Validated against Redshift queries.

Improved productivity with context-aware query recommendations.

➡️ Step-by-step guide

🛡 Guardrails

Safety & privacy filters for enterprise AI.

Prevented hallucinations & dataset poisoning.

Enforced compliance in production deployments.

🧩 Agentic Workflows

Combined Foundation Models, Prompts, Knowledge Bases, Agents, Guardrails.

Built scalable workflows with AWS Lambda & Amazon Lex integration.

🏁 Conclusion

This workshop showed how to move from GenAI prototypes to production with Amazon Bedrock, Nova, and Q – focusing on scalability, safety, and enterprise-grade design.
